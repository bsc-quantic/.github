Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

We are the Quantic research group! Located at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC), our research focuses on:

- [Quantum Algorithms](https://www.bsc.es/research-development/research-areas/quantum-information/quantum-algorithms)
- [Tensor Networks](https://www.bsc.es/research-development/research-areas/quantum-information/tensor-networks)

Many of our libraries are developed in Julia, which you can access them by adding our registry:

```julia
using Pkg
pkg"registry add https://github.com/bsc-quantic/Registry"
```
